Law enforcement organizations and legislators have been searching for novel ways to increase crime prevention tactics and public safety because of the recent spike in crime rates. Using data mining techniques to examine crime data is one such method that offers insightful information on trends, patterns, and correlations in crime. 
To analyze past crime data, spot underlying trends, and forecast future instances of criminal activity, this research will make use of data mining techniques. This research will unearth important data that will help law enforcement organizations allocate resources, prevent crime, and develop strategic plans. In the end, this analysis's conclusions will aid in the creation of data-driven policies that improve community safety.
