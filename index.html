        <h1>US Crime Analysis</h1>
        <h2>1. INTRODUCTION </h2>
        <p>We are a team of three consisting of,</p>

            <p>Pranav Vinayak Chopdekar, Nikhil Jaswaraj Karkera, Mahendra Varmah Vaddi and we are doing a project upon crime data analysis</p>
        </p>
            As we speak, crime has been rising over the last few decades. Numerous crimes are committed that violate people's moral and ethical principles. Every week, thousands of instances are reported in the USA. It turns out that some of these cases are also quite serious.
            Law enforcement organizations and legislators have been searching for novel ways to increase crime prevention tactics and public safety because of the recent spike in crime rates. Using data mining techniques to examine crime data is one such method that offers insightful information on trends, patterns, and correlations in crime. 
            To analyze past crime data, spot underlying trends, and forecast future instances of criminal activity, this research will make use of data mining techniques. This research will unearth important data that will help law enforcement organizations allocate resources, prevent crime, and develop strategic plans. In the end, this analysis's conclusions will aid in the creation of data-driven policies that improve community safety.
            The information we selected was obtained from the US government website and includes almost one lakh rows with information on the county in which the incident occurred, the type of offense committed, and the age of the offender. We would be able to extract significant insights by utilizing R and Python.
            </p>

            <h2>The Nature of the Topic</h2>
            <p>
                This project focuses on analyzing crime data across the United States to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies over time. The study encompasses various types of crimes, including violent crimes, property crimes, and cybercrimes, across different regions and demographics. The goal is to gain insights into crime distribution and contributing factors such as socio-economic conditions, geography, and law enforcement efficacy.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Why It Is Important</h2>
            <p>
                Crime analysis is crucial for improving public safety and guiding law enforcement efforts. Understanding crime patterns helps authorities allocate resources more effectively, identify high-risk areas, and implement policies that target the root causes of crime. It also aids policymakers and community leaders in designing preventive strategies, ultimately leading to safer communities. Additionally, analyzing crime trends can help predict and reduce future criminal activities.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Who Is Affected</h2>
            <p>
                Crime affects various groups of people, including victims, perpetrators, law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the general public. Victims and their families experience direct consequences, while the broader community faces fear, economic costs, and diminished quality of life. Law enforcement agencies are impacted by the need to allocate resources efficiently, and policymakers must address rising crime rates while ensuring social justice. Ultimately, the safety and well-being of every citizen are at stake.
            </p>
        
            <h2>What Has Been Done So Far and What Gaps Remain</h2>
            <p>
                Numerous studies have analyzed U.S. crime data, leading to the development of various crime prevention strategies and policies. Data-driven policing models, such as predictive policing, have been implemented in several cities. However, significant gaps remain in addressing the underlying causes of crime, particularly regarding socio-economic inequality and mental health issues. Additionally, there is limited research on the effectiveness of current interventions, and the impact of new forms of crime, such as cybercrime, remains underexplored.
            </p>

        <h2>2. DATA COLLECTION/PREPARATION, CLEANING & VISUALIZATION</h2>
        <h3>DATA COLLECTION </h3>
        <p>We successfully fetched data from the Cincinnati Police Department web portal using their provided API. However, due to a limitation that allows the API to return only 1000 records per request, we had to implement pagination to ensure we retrieved the complete dataset. This involved making multiple requests, adjusting the parameters in each call to sequentially collect the next batch of records until the entire dataset was obtained. By automating this process, we ensured data consistency and completeness for our analysis.</p>

        <h4>1.K NEARESRT NEIGHBOUR </h4>
        <p>
            In our KNN modeling, we have used UCR (Uniform Crime Reporting) as our target variable because it provides a standardized way of categorizing crimes into broad classifications, such as violent crimes or property crimes. Using UCR as the target allows us to focus on understanding crime patterns and trends, which can help in resource allocation, law enforcement planning, and crime prevention efforts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since UCR is a universally recognized crime reporting system, it makes our analysis more relevant and actionable, aligning it with real-world applications like policymaking and identifying crime hotspots. This ensures that our findings can be effectively used to address and understand criminal activity.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            The model performed exceptionally well for <strong>class 3</strong> and <strong>class 4</strong>, with F1-scores of <strong>0.90</strong> and <strong>0.94</strong>, respectively, indicating high precision and recall for these classes. However, performance for <strong>class 2</strong> was poor, with an F1-score of <strong>0.08</strong>, and <strong>class 7</strong> had a score of <strong>0.00</strong>, highlighting challenges in identifying these classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The macro-average F1-score is <strong>0.56</strong>, reflecting the imbalance in performance across classes, while the weighted average F1-score is <strong>0.80</strong>, indicating overall performance weighted by class support. These results suggest that while the model works well for majority classes, it struggles with underrepresented or minority classes, which might require further optimization or rebalancing of the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>High Accuracy for Class 3: Class 3 has the highest correctly classified instances with 19,041, indicating excellent performance for this class.
            Misclassifications: Class 0 shows significant misclassification, with 962 instances predicted as Class 3. Class 5 has 857 instances misclassified as Class 3 and 242 instances misclassified as Class 0. Other classes like 1, 4, 6, and 7 also show some degree of misclassification, though less severe.
            Confusion for Neighboring Classes: The confusion is noticeable for classes that are "neighboring" or similar in data space, e.g., misclassification between Classes 5 and 3.
            Sparse Misclassifications: Certain classes have very few non-zero values for off-diagonal elements, such as Class 7, where most predictions fall under Class 7 with minor misclassifications.
            Dominant Class Sizes: Class 3 dominates the dataset in terms of size, as reflected by the large count of true and predicted values compared to other classes.

            In this model, we are predicting the VICTIM_ETHNICITY using UCR_GROUP as the input feature. The significance of calculating this variable lies in its potential to provide insights into how different crime categories are associated with specific victim demographics. This can help law enforcement and policymakers identify trends, address potential biases, and allocate resources effectively to support vulnerable groups. By understanding these relationships, interventions can be tailored to improve community safety and inclusivity.
The model's output shows an accuracy of 93.08%, meaning that the predictions are highly accurate for the test dataset. The F1-score is 89.74%, which indicates that the model has a strong balance between precision and recall, ensuring reliable results across various categories. Overall, the Random Forest classifier demonstrates its effectiveness in classifying victim ethnicity based on crime group data. However, further fine-tuning, feature engineering, or incorporating additional variables might enhance the model's performance and provide even deeper insights.
