        <h1>US Crime Analysis</h1>
        <p>We are a team of three consisting of,</p>

            <p>Pranav Vinayak Chopdekar, Nikhil Jaswaraj Karkera, Mahendra Varmah Vaddi and we are doing a project upon crime data analysis</p>
        </p>
            As we speak, crime has been rising over the last few decades. Numerous crimes are committed that violate people's moral and ethical principles. Every week, thousands of instances are reported in the USA. It turns out that some of these cases are also quite serious.
            Law enforcement organizations and legislators have been searching for novel ways to increase crime prevention tactics and public safety because of the recent spike in crime rates. Using data mining techniques to examine crime data is one such method that offers insightful information on trends, patterns, and correlations in crime. 
            To analyze past crime data, spot underlying trends, and forecast future instances of criminal activity, this research will make use of data mining techniques. This research will unearth important data that will help law enforcement organizations allocate resources, prevent crime, and develop strategic plans. In the end, this analysis's conclusions will aid in the creation of data-driven policies that improve community safety.
            The information we selected was obtained from the US government website and includes almost one lakh rows with information on the county in which the incident occurred, the type of offense committed, and the age of the offender. We would be able to extract significant insights by utilizing R and Python.
